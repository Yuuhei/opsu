# opsu!
A fork of [Opsu](https://github.com/itdelatrisu/opsu) using libgdx to fake slicks API.


NOTE: I gonna try to port this on [iOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil) Devices.
A low success rate porting this is predicted bcoz i have limited knowledge on [iOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil) coding.

Sorry for bad [english](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language)
